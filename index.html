				<p>The Department of Education and The World Bank ask KLL to support an assessment of damage to schools because of KLL’s expertise in mobile data collection technology. KLL developed a mobile data collection app KLL Collect SIDA. 2400 Civil engineers were deployed in the field in phase I of the project ((Districts: Ramechhap, Kavrepalanchowk, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Okhaldhunga, Makwanpur, Sindhuli). Phase I is complete and the phase II (Districts: Nuwakot, Rasuwa, Gorkha, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Dolakha) started from Dec 17, 2015.</p>

				<h2> KLL's Reconstruction Phase Begins as its Earthquake Response Comes to a Close
</h2>
				<p>Kathmandu Living Labs closes QuakeMap.org, marking the move from earthquake response to reconstruction. Work on School Infrastructure Damage Assessment (SIDA) accelerates. The updated OpenStreetMap data--created by the work of 9,000 volunteers from around the world--continues to serve as an important resource. Meanwhile, KLL begins working with partners in the Nepal government and major international organizations on a housing damage assessment. The assessment uses mobile data collection to assess housing damage through all earthquake affected districts.
